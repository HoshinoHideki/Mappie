Mappie

This little project is something I've made a couple of years ago to help with my manga translator's tasks.

The program asks you to point it to a picture file in a folder of pictures, then makes a list of all pictures in this folder, and then feeds these pictures to an imprompu visual "editor", one by one.

The "editor" then makes a small white circle with a number in it, at a specific place where you press a left mouse button.

The number inside a circle starts with "1", then the next circle continues with "2", the one after it goes with "3", etc.

Once you're done with placing the circles, by pressing the "space" button the script then saves the image inside a new folder created in the folder that has your images, with all marks you've made. This way, you can still have both intact "raw" images and new "processed" images separately.

The script also resizes the input image to a reasonable size (so as to fit my own screen) and saves them scaled-down.

There's also functionality for undoing the circle (backspace button), going back to a certain number (only 1-9, with the corresponding keyboard keys), and for aborting the script completely (esc.)
